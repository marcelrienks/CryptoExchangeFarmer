# Crypto Exchange Trader Bot

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/tdt1ejffp8wyl8de?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/marcelrienks/CryptoExchangeTrader)  
Crypto Exchange Trader is a Crypto Currency Trading bot.
This tool will use configuration information that you specify to automate trades on supported exchanges.  

**_NOTE: this project is very much under development._**  
The framework for the project has been completed, and some popular cryto exchanges have been added.
Work still needs to be done on actually coding the bots themselves, according to a strategy of your choice.
